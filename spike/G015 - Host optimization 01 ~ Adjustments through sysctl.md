# G015 - Host optimization 01 ~ Adjustments through `sysctl`

You can get performance improvements in your system just by setting some parameters in `sysctl` configuration files. Remember that you did something like this for hardening the TCP/IP stack in the [**G012** guide](G012%20-%20Host%20hardening%2006%20~%20Network%20hardening%20with%20sysctl.md).

The changes explained in the following sections are focused on improving the performance of your system on different concerns. For the sake of clarity, each concern will have its own `sysctl` file with their own particular parameter set. This is meant to avoid the problem of having the same parameter defined twice on different configuration files, and worrying about in which order are being read (`sysctl` only keeps the last value read for each parameter).

> **BEWARE!**  
> You should revise and adjust the values set in the following sections to suit your own system setup and presumed load.

In this guide, you're going to create a bunch of sysctl configuration files that all have to be placed in the `/etc/sysctl.d`. So, `cd` to that path and start working on the sections below.

~~~bash
$ cd /etc/sysctl.d/

## Network optimizations

1. Create a new empty file called `85_network_optimizations.conf`.

    ~~~bash
    $ sudo touch 85_network_optimizations.conf
    ~~~

2. Edit the `85_network_optimizations.conf` file and input the following content.

    ~~~properties

    # TCP Fast Open is an extension to the transmission control protocol (TCP)
    # that helps reduce network latency by enabling data to be exchanged during
    # the sender’s initial TCP SYN [3]. Using the value 3 instead of the default 1
    # allows TCP Fast Open for both incoming and outgoing connections.
    net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3

    # Wait a maximum of 5 * 2 = 10 seconds in the TIME_WAIT state after a FIN,

    # Keepalive optimizations
    #
    # TCP keepalive is a mechanism for TCP connections that help to determine whether
    # the other end has stopped responding or not. TCP will send the keepalive probe
    # that contains null data to the network peer several times after a period of idle
    # time. If the peer does not respond, the socket will be closed automatically.
    #
    # By default, the keepalive routines wait for two hours (7200 secs)
    # before sending the first keepalive probe, and then resend it every 75 seconds.
    # If no ACK response is received for 9 consecutive times, the connection
    # is marked as broken. As long as there is TCP/IP socket communications going on
    # and active, no keepalive packets are needed.
    #
    # The default values are:
    # tcp_keepalive_time = 7200, tcp_keepalive_intvl = 75, tcp_keepalive_probes = 9
    #
    # We would decrease the default values for tcp_keepalive_* params as follow:
    #

## Reboot the system

Although you've applied the changes with the `sysctl -p` command, it'll be better to restart your server too.

~~~bash
$ sudo reboot
~~~

Then, open a new shell as your `mgrsys` user and check the log files (`syslog` in particular) under the `/var/log` directory to look for possible errors or warnings related to your changes.

## Final considerations

All the values modified in the previous sections have to be measured and tested against the possibilities of your system and the real load it has. So expect to revise this configuration later to fit it better to your needs, and maybe even adjust some other `sysctl` parameters that haven't been shown in this guide.

On the other hand, notice how I avoided touching any `sysctl` configuration files already present in the system (like the ones related to the PVE platform). This guarantees that future updates can change them without complaining about being different as they expected them to be.
